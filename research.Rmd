I currently don't have much research to boast about-  I've dabbled in trying to prove the Collatz conjecture to no avail.  My friend (a physics major) and I are currently working on our own little invention which will remain a secret until further notice.  Check in regularly for possible updates!  It should be a big deal when finished.  In the mean time though, check out a vine that I made back in highschool and get paid for!  I didn't take the video I just posted it and by the time Vine was taken down it had reached around 50 million loops.  I usually make around $50 per month off of it!  Here is a youtube video of it:
